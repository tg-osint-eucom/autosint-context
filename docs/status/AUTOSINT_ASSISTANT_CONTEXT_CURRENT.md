# AUTOSINT Assistant Context Current

This is a public, sanitized context file for restoring AUTOSINT project context in ChatGPT/Codex. It is derived from private AUTOSINT source-of-truth docs and safe local status, without copying runtime artifacts or private browser state.

## Source

- Private code/runtime repo: `tg-osint-eucom/autosint`
- Public context mirror: `tg-osint-eucom/autosint-context`
- Source branch: `main`
- Source HEAD: `dc8851f18338c1d03b93d508887e388d13f11360`
- Generated at: `2026-06-22T02:00:17Z`

## Primary Workflow

`Mission Control -> External Scout -> TSOC/HAVOC -> HAVOC/RFI -> future controlled approval`

## Primary Route Roles

- `/mission-control`: operator launch page and workflow overview.
- `/external-scout`: latest active validated External Scout packet review.
- `/tsoc-havoc`: theater/workspace organization.
- `/havoc-rfi/SOCCENT`: packet-driven HAVOC/RFI preview.

## Supporting And Audit Surfaces

- `/canonical-cases`: canonical case index and evidence lineage entrypoint.
- `/case-genesis`: dry-run candidate review.
- Evidence passports, OSIR previews, PIR APIs, agent feed, source coverage, and source health are supporting/audit surfaces unless a later task promotes them.

## External Scout Status

- Available: `True`
- Active selection policy: `latest_validated_capture_only`
- Active packet count: `0`
- History packet count: `0`
- Latest packet timestamp: `not available`
- Stale: `True`
- Read-only: `True`
- Private browser state read: `False`
- Cookies read: `False`
- Local storage read: `False`

## HAVOC/RFI Behavior

HAVOC/RFI uses the best validated External Scout packet when available; canonical cases, Case Genesis, TSOC/HAVOC, source coverage, and provenance remain audit material.

## Capture Bridge

Visible/file-first capture is local-only and feeds staging/quarantine before inbox promotion.

## Local-Only Runtime

The following are local-only and are not mirrored here:

- ChatGPT browser session and visible capture state.
- launchd capture jobs.
- External Scout inbox, latest, staging, quarantine, receipts, and logs.
- Local DB files and DB runtime state.
- Browser cookies, storage, profile files, credentials, tokens, and `.env` values.

## Latest Source Commits

- `dc8851f feat(docs): automate AUTOSINT context mirror publishing`
- `bcc4baa docs: add AUTOSINT autopush policy`
- `7809c01 chore(github): add AUTOSINT CI workflow`
- `f93b412 feat: initialize AUTOSINT operator review stack`

## Source Dirty State

- clean

## Pending Decisions

- Keep the mirror refreshed after major workflow changes.
- Install/load hourly capture only after separate operator approval.
- Build External Scout Case Threads before relying on hourly packet history as case continuity.
- Design controlled approval before Evidence or case-link mutation.

## Safety Boundary

- ChatGPT packets are candidate input only, not Evidence.
- Review surfaces do not perform DB writes, raw Evidence mutation, case-link mutation, source-config mutation, OSIR bypass, commander-ready promotion, apply/import actions, launchd install/load/start, or frontend write controls.
- Market, crypto, prediction-market, social, and public-comment material remains cue-only.
